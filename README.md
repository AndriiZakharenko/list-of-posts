# React + Redux list of posts


Implemented it with Redux having the next slice:
- `users` and remove `UsersContext`;
- `author` that is currently in the `App`;
- `posts` having 3 props `loaded`, `hasError` and `items`;
- `selectedPost`;
- `comments` with `loaded`, `hasError` and `items` props (keep the `visible` in the `PostDetails`);
- `NewCommentForm` should keep its state.
